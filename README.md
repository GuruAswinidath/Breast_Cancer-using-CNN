# Breast_Cancer-using-CNN
  
  
**##Introduction**

This project aims to detect breast cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to provide a machine learning-based solution for accurate breast cancer diagnosis, leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms.

**##Dataset**

The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model is [name of the dataset]. It consists of a large number of labeled breast cancer images, with corresponding information indicating whether the image represents a malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) tumor. The dataset has been preprocessed and is ready for training.
