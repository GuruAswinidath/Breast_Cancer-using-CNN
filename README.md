# Breast_Cancer-using-CNN
  
  
**Introduction**

This project aims to detect breast cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to provide a machine learning-based solution for accurate breast cancer diagnosis, leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms.

The key challenge in breast cancer detection is to classify tumors as malignant or benign. Malignant refers to cancer cells that can invade and kill nearby tissue and spread to other parts of your body. Unlike cancerous tumor(malignant), Benign does not spread to other parts of the body and is safe somehow. Deep neural network techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of early diagnosis significantly.

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms.
